# HykuKnapsack

[Hyku Knapsack](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack) is a little wrapper around Hyku to make development and deployment easier. Primary goals of this project
include making contributing back to the Hyku project easier and making upgrades a snap.

## Introduction

[Hyku](https://github.com/samvera/hyku) is a Rails application that leverages Rails Engines and other gems to provide functionality.  A Hyku Knapsack is also a Rails engine, but it integrates differently than other engines.

### Precedence

In a traditional setup, a Rails' application's views, translations, and code supsedes all other gems and engines.  However, we have setup Hyku Knapsack to have a higher load precedence than the underlying Hyku application.

The goal being that a Hyku Knapsack should make it easier to maintain, upgrade, and contribute fixes back to Hyku.

See [Overrides](#overrides) for more discussion on working with a Hyku Knapsack.

## Usage

### Creating Your Knapsack

In working on a Hyku Knapsack, you want to be able to track changes in the upstream knapsack as well as make local changes for your application.  Start by making a clone.  You can do this by:

- _Preferred_ Creating a [New Repository](#new-repository) and pushing your local clone
- Creating a [Fork on Github](#fork-on-github)

#### New Repository

In your Repository host of choice, create a new (and for now empty) repository.

- `$PROJECT_NAME` must only contain letters, numbers and underscores due to a bundler limitation.
- `$NEW_REPO_URL` is the location of your application's knapsack git project (e.g. https://github.com/my-org/my_org_knapsack)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack $PROJECT_NAME_knapsack
cd $PROJECT_NAME_knapsack
git remote rename origin prime
git remote add origin $NEW_REPO_URL
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Naming the `samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack` as `prime` helps clarify what we mean.  In conversations about Hyku instances, invariably we use the language of Prime to reflect what's in Samvera's repositories.  By using that language for remotes, we help reinforce the concept that `https://github.com/samvera/hyku` is Hyku prime and `https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack` is Knapsack prime.

#### Fork on Github

If you choose to fork Knapsack, be aware that this will impact how you manage pull requests via Github.  Namely as you submit PRs on your Fork, the UI might default to applying that to the fork's origin (e.g. Knapsack upstream).

To ease synchronization of your Knapsack and Knapsack "prime", consider adding knapsack prime as a remote:

```bash
cd $PROJECT_NAME_knapsack
git remote add prime https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack
```

### Keeping Your Knapsack Updated with Prime

Whether you've set up your Knapsack using a new repository or a fork, you may want to pull in updates from `hyku_knapsack` prime (i.e., `https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack`) over time. To do this, ensure you've added the upstream remote as `prime`:

```bash
git remote add prime https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack
```

To fetch and merge in changes from the prime repository:

```bash
git fetch prime
git merge prime/main
```

If you prefer a cleaner commit history, you may rebase instead:

```bash
git fetch prime
git rebase prime/main
```

After resolving any conflicts, push the updates to your repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This setup ensures your Knapsack stays aligned with ongoing improvements and bug fixes in the Hyku Knapsack project.


### Hyku and HykuKnapsack

You run your Hyku application by way of the HykuKnapsack.  As mentioned, the HykuKnapsack contains your application's relevant information for running an instance of Hyku.

There are two things you need to do:

- Ensure you have the [reserved branch](#reserved-branch)
- Initialize the [Hyku submodule](#hyku-submodule)

#### Reserved Branch

Knapsack turns the assumptions of a Rails engine upside-down; the application overlays traditional engines, but Knapsack overlays the application.  As such the Gemfile declared in Hyku does some bundler trickery.

In the `$PROJECT_NAME_knapsack` directory, you need to run the following:

```bash
git fetch prime
git checkout prime/required_for_knapsack_instances
git switch -c required_for_knapsack_instances
```

For Hyku to build with Knapsack, we need a local branch named `required_for_knapsack_instances`.  _Note:_ As we work more with Knapsack maintenance there may be improvements to this shim.

#### Hyku Submodule

A newly cloned knapsack will have an empty `./hyrax-webapp` directory.  That is where the Hyku application will exist.  The version of Hyku is managed via a [Git submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule).

To bring that application into your knapsack, you will need to initialize the Hyku submodule:

```bash
‚ùØ git submodule init
Submodule 'hyrax-webapp' (https://github.com/samvera/hyku.git) registered for path 'hyrax-webapp'
```

Then update the submodule to clone the remote Hyku repository into `./hyrax-webapp`.  The `KNAPSACK-SPECIFIED-HYKU-REPOSITORY-SHA` is managed within the Hyku Knapsack (via Git submodules).

```bash
‚ùØ git submodule update
Cloning into '/path/to/$PROJECT_NAME_knapsack/hyrax-webapp'...
Submodule path 'hyrax-webapp': checked out '<KNAPSACK-SPECIFIED-HYKU-REPOSITORY-SHA>'
```

The configuration of the submodule can be found in the `./.gitmodules` file.  During development, we've specified the submodule's branch (via `git submodule set-branch --branch <NAME> -- ./hyrax-webapp`).

Below is an example of our Adventist Knapsack submodule.

```
‚ùØ cat .gitmodules
[submodule "hyrax-webapp"]
	path = hyrax-webapp
	url = https://github.com/samvera/hyku.git
	branch = adventist_dev
```

When you want to bring down an updated version of your Hyku submodule, use the following:

```bash
> git submodule update --remote
```

This will checkout the submodule to the HEAD of the specified branch.

### üöÄ Getting Started with Stack Car

Hyku Knapsack uses [Stack Car](https://github.com/notch8/stack_car) to manage Docker-based development.
For alternative setup options, refer to [Hyku's Getting Started](https://github.com/samvera/hyku/blob/main/docs/getting-started.md).

> **Important:** All commands below should be run from the **root of your Knapsack project**, **not** from within the `hyrax-webapp` submodule.

#### 1. Install Stack Car (if you haven't already)

```bash
gem install stack_car
```

#### 2. Set up the development proxy

You only need to run this once per installed version of Stack Car:

```bash
sc proxy cert
sc proxy up
```

#### 3. Prepare and start the stack

```bash
sc pull     # Pull the latest base images
sc build    # Build your local image
sc up       # Start the container stack
```

#### 4. Open the app in your browser

Once running, visit:

```
https://admin-{repo-name}.localhost.direct/
```

Example (for the Hyku Knapsack repo):

```
https://admin-hyku-knapsack.localhost.direct/
```

#### 5. Open a shell in the container (if needed)

```bash
sc sh
```

### Overrides

Before overriding anything, please think hard (or ask the community) about whether what you are working on is a bug or feature that can apply to Hyku itself. If it is, please make a branch in your Hyku checkout (`./hyrax-webapp`) and do the work there. Read more about [working with Hyku branches in your Knapsack](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/wiki/Hyku-Branches).

Adding decorators to override features is fairly simple. We do recommend some [best practices](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/wiki/Decorators-and-Overrides).

Any file with `_decorator.rb` in the app or lib directory will automatically be loaded along with any classes in the app directory.

### Deployment scripts

Deployment code can be added as needed.

### Theme files

Theme files (views, css, etc) can be added to the knapsack. We recommend adding an [override comment](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/wiki/Decorators-and-Overrides#best-practices-for-view-overrides)

### Gems

It can be useful to add additional gems to the bundle. This can be done without editing Hyku by adding them to the [./bundler.d/example.rb](./bundler.d/example.rb).  [See the bundler-inject documentation for more details](https://github.com/kbrock/bundler-inject/) on overriding and adding gems.

**NOTE:** Do not add gems to the gemspec nor Gemfile.  When you add to the knapsack Gemfile/gemspec, when you bundle, you'll update the Hyku Gemfile; which will mean you might be updating Hyku prime with knapsack installation specific dependencies.  Instead add gems to `./bundler.d/example.rb`.

### Work Resource Generator

This project includes a Rails generator to create new custom work types within your Hyku Knapsack application. This generator is a modified version of the one provided by Hyrax, specifically adapted to ensure that all generated files are created within the knapsack directory structure, rather than in the core Hyku submodule.

To use the generator, run the following command from the root of your knapsack project:

```bash
bundle exec rails generate hyku_knapsack:work_resource WorkType
```
Replace `WorkType` with the desired name for your new work type. The generator will create the necessary model, controller, form, indexer, and view files in the appropriate directories within the knapsack.

## Converting a Fork of Hyku Prime to a Knapsack

Prior to Hyku Knapsack, organizations would likely clone [Hyku](https://github.com/samvera/hyku) and begin changing the code to reflect their specific needs.  The result was that the clone would often drift away from Samvera Hyku version.  This drift created challenges in reconciling what you had changed locally as well as how you could easily contribute some of your changes upstream to Samvera's Hyku.

With Hyku Knapsack, the goal is three-fold:

1. To isolate the upstream Samvera Hyku code from your local modifications.  This isolation is via the `./hyrax-webapp` submodule.
2. To provide a clear and separate space for extending/overriding Hyku functionality.
3. To provide a cleaner pathway for upgrading the underlying Hyku application; for things such as security updates, bug fixes, and upstream enhancements.

From those goals, we can begin to see what we want in our Hyku Knapsack:

1. Files that are not found in Hyku
2. Or files that are different from what is in Hyku (and thus will be loaded at a higher precedence)

Assuming you're working from a fork of Samvera's Hyku repository, these are some general steps.  First clone the Hyku Knapsack ([see the Usage section](#usage)).  You'll also want to initialize the git submodule.  Point the `./hyrax-webapp` to the branch/SHA of Samvera's Hyku that you want to use; **Note:** that version must include a `gem 'hyku_knapsack'` declaration (e.g. introduced in  [7853fe5d](https://github.com/samvera/hyku/blob/7853fe5d79afd9d90cec3b9ef666681b287ef4d0/Gemfile)).

You'll also want to have a local copy of your Hyku application.

You can then use `bin/knapsacker` to generate a list of files that need review.  That will give you a list of:

- Files in your Hyku that are exact duplicates of upstream Hyku file (prefix with `=`)
- Files that are in your Hyku but not in upstream Hyku (prefixed with `+`)
- Files that are changed in your Hyku relative to upstream Hyku (prefix with `Œî`)

You can pipe that output into a file and begin working on reviewing and moving files into the Knapsack.  This is not an easy to automate task, after all we're paying down considerable tech debt.

Once you've moved over the files, you'll want to boot up your Knapsack and then work through your test plan.

The `bin/knapsacker` is general purpose.  I have used it to compare one non-Knapsack Hyku instance against Samvera's Hyku.  I have also used it to compare a Knapsack's file against it's submodule Hyku instance.

## Using the Knapsacker Tool

The `bin/knapsacker` tool is a powerful utility for comparing files between different Hyku repositories. It helps identify which files are duplicates, which are unique, and which have been modified - making it easier to migrate from a traditional Hyku fork to a Knapsack structure or compare your Knapsack against upstream changes.

### Basic Usage

```bash
bin/knapsacker -y <your-directory> -u <upstream-directory>
```

#### Parameters

- `-y` (yours): Path to your Hyku repository or the directory you want to compare
- `-u` (upstream): Path to the upstream/reference repository to compare against

### Common Use Cases

#### 1. Comparing Your Hyku Fork Against Knapsack Prime
If you have an existing Hyku fork and want to see what needs to be moved to a Knapsack:

```bash
bin/knapsacker -y /path/to/your-hyku-fork -u .
```

#### 2. Comparing Your Knapsack Against Its Hyku Submodule
To see what files in your Knapsack differ from the underlying Hyku application:

```bash
bin/knapsacker -y . -u ./hyrax-webapp
```

#### 3. Comparing Any Two Hyku Repositories
```bash
bin/knapsacker -y /path/to/repo-a -u /path/to/repo-b
```

### Understanding the Output

The knapsacker generates three categories of files:

#### Files with `=` prefix
**exact duplicates** - Files in "yours" that are identical to "upstream" files. These typically don't need to be in your Knapsack since they're already provided by the base Hyku application.

#### Files with `+` prefix  
**unique to yours** - Files that exist in your repository but not in upstream. These are candidates for inclusion in your Knapsack as they represent custom functionality.

#### Files with `Œî` prefix
**modified files** - Files that exist in both repositories but have different content. These need review to determine if the changes should be moved to your Knapsack.

### Example Output

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Knapsacker run context:
------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Working Directory: /Users/example/hyku_knapsack
- Your Dir: /path/to/your-hyku
- Upstream Dir: .
- Patterns to Check:
  - spec/**/*.*
  - app/**/*.*
  - lib/**/*.*

------------------------------------------------------------------
Files in "yours" that are exact duplicates of "upstream" files
They are prefixed with a `='
------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------
Files that are in "yours" but not in "upstream" 
They are prefixed with a `+'
----------------------------------------------------
+ app/models/custom_work.rb
+ app/controllers/custom_controller.rb
+ lib/custom_service.rb

-------------------------------------------------------------
Files that are changed in "yours" relative to "upstream"
They are prefixed with a `Œî'
-------------------------------------------------------------
Œî config/application.rb
Œî app/models/user.rb
```

### Migration Workflow

1. **Run the comparison**: Use knapsacker to generate the file comparison
2. **Review `+` files**: These likely need to be copied to your Knapsack
3. **Analyze `Œî` files**: Determine which changes are customizations vs. bug fixes
   - Bug fixes should ideally be contributed back to Hyku prime
   - Customizations should be moved to your Knapsack as decorators/overrides
4. **Ignore `=` files**: These don't need to be in your Knapsack

### Tips

- **Pipe output to a file** for easier review: `bin/knapsacker -y ../your-hyku -u . > comparison.txt`
- **Focus on meaningful changes**: Not all `Œî` files need to be moved - some differences might be configuration or environment-specific
- **Use decorators when possible**: Instead of wholesale file replacement, consider using Rails decorators for modifications. See [best practices](https://github.com/samvera-labs/hyku_knapsack/wiki/Decorators-and-Overrides)
- **Test thoroughly**: After migration, ensure your Knapsack works correctly with your changes
